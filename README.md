# L-system
> A Basic implementation of an L-System along with an interpreter written with the Turtle graphics library.

### 📓About
An [L-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) is a type of formal grammar used to create artificial plants (and more) in procedural content generation. This repository is a very simple implementation of an L-System and a Stochastic L-System generator in Java. There is also a 2D implementation of a graphical interpreter written with the `Turtle` graphics library.

The L-System generates strings through formal grammar production rules, and then the LSystemInterpreter interprates the strings as directions for drawing on the screen, thus drawing the plant like forms.

### 👩‍💻How to Run
1. Make sure you have Java Installed
2. `javac src/*.java`
3. `java -cp src Demo`
